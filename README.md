# Calendarful

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benplummer/calendarful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benplummer/calendarful)

Calendarful is a simple and easily extendable PHP solution that allows the generation of occurrences of recurring events, thus eliminating the need to store hundreds or maybe thousands of occurrences in a database or other methods of storage. This package ships with default implementations of interfaces for use out of the box although it is very simple to provide your own implementations if needs be.
